# Loan_Eligibility_Predictor
Machine learning model in Jupyter Notebook and UI built on streamlit.
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant details such as income, credit history, loan amount, and other factors.
It uses machine learning models (Decision Tree & Gaussian Naive Bayes) and is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app.

The project helps automate the loan approval process and demonstrates skills in:
Data preprocessing & feature engineering
Model building and evaluation using scikit-learn
Web deployment using Streamlit
